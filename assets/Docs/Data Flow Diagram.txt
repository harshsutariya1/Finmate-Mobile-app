Create a multi-level Data Flow Diagram (DFD) for the Finmate mobile application showing:

Level 0 (Context Diagram):
- External entities: User, Firebase Authentication, Firestore Database, Firebase Storage
- Single central process: Finmate App
- Main data flows between external entities and the central process

Level 1 (Main Processes):
1. Authentication System
   - Inputs: User credentials, Google account data
   - Outputs: Authentication status, user profile

2. Transaction Management System
   - Inputs: Transaction details, filter criteria
   - Outputs: Transaction records, filtered transactions, transaction statistics

3. Group Management System
   - Inputs: Group details, member information, group transactions
   - Outputs: Group status, member balances, group transaction records

4. Account Management System
   - Inputs: Bank account details, cash amounts
   - Outputs: Account balances, linked accounts

5. Budget Management System
   - Inputs: Budget allocations, category amounts
   - Outputs: Budget status, spending vs. budget reports

6. Analytics System
   - Inputs: Transaction data, time periods
   - Outputs: Charts, summaries, spending patterns

Level 2 (Detail for Transaction Management):
1. Process: Add Transaction
   - Sub-processes: Validate input, Update balances, Update budget
   - Data stores: Transactions, Accounts, Budgets

2. Process: Filter Transactions
   - Sub-processes: Apply category filter, Apply date filter, Apply account filter
   - Data stores: Transactions

3. Process: Transfer Funds
   - Sub-processes: Validate accounts, Process withdrawal, Process deposit
   - Data stores: Transactions, Accounts

Data Stores:
1. Users
2. Transactions
3. Groups
4. Bank Accounts
5. Budgets
6. Group Chats

Key Data Flows:
1. User authentication flow: Credentials → Firebase Auth → User ID → Fetch user data
2. Transaction creation flow: Transaction details → Validation → Database storage → Balance updates
3. Group management flow: Group details → Create group → Add members → Calculate balances
4. Budget tracking flow: Expense transaction → Update budget spent amount → Calculate remaining

Use proper DFD notation with processes (circles/rounded rectangles), external entities (rectangles), data stores (open-ended rectangles/parallel lines), and data flows (arrows with labels). Show bidirectional flows where appropriate.
